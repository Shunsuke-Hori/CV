\section*{WORKING PAPERS}
``The Secular Decline in Aggregate Hours Worked in Japan: A Reinterpretation'' (Job Market Paper)
\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
Abstract: Average hours worked per adult in Japan fell by around one third over the last half-century. The leading explanation focuses on government policies that distort labor supply decisions. This paper provides a new interpretation that stresses the role of income effects in preferences. Through the lens of a model of the market and home sectors and using non-homothetic preferences, I show that the main driver of Japan's decline in hours worked is income effects, rather than labor-market distortions or population aging. The model predicts that average hours of leisure will rise and home-production hours will remain roughly constant over the period, which is consistent with evidence from time-use surveys. An alternative calibration based on only labor market distortions counterfactually predicts that home production hours will rise.

``Quarantine and Its Scar on Labor'' Joint with Asako Chiba and Taisuke Nakata
\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
Abstract: During the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments recommended quarantine to those who had close contact with infected individuals. We conducted a large-scale retrospective survey to study the consequences of such quarantine for labor outcomes. A sizable fraction of quarantined workers experienced reductions in hours worked and earnings, not only during quarantine but also after quarantine. Even uninfected workers experienced negative labor impacts, likely capturing the pure effects of quarantine independent of the effects of Covid-19 symptoms. Non-regular workers and workers without remote work options were more negatively affected by quarantine. We estimate that the quarantine resulted in a large reduction in the aggregate hours and that the reduction is mainly due to the scarring effects.

``COVID-19 Infection and Its Labor Supply Impact: Evidence from a Large-scale Survey in Japan'' Joint with Asako Chiba, Taisuke Nakata, Shusaku Sasaki, Reo Takaku
\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
Abstract: We conduct a large-scale retrospective survey to investigate how COVID-19 infection affected the labor outcomes of infected workers in Japan. Many infected workers --- including those without any COVID-19 symptoms --- experienced some reductions in hours worked or earnings immediately after infection. The negative labor impacts often lasted for more than a month. The negative labor impacts were particularly pronounced for contract workers, non-regular workers, workers without access to work-from-home, and those unvaccinated. Our estimate based on the survey and other official statistics indicates that COVID-19 infection had a non-negligible negative impact on the aggregate labor supply in 2022.
